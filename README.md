These programs go into the things we were taught recently which were Recursions, Queues, and Maps. For the First program you were supossed to move the second element to the first and push the first to the back.

For the second program we use recursion function to figure out if the user is typing a palindrome or not. IF the word reads the same left to right and right to left the statement would be true.![Question 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57150728/206624680-329ecbd3-3fc5-4957-8baa-c1a767a11258.jpg)
 Lastly our last program has a map of acouple of states and capitals of those states, one of the states we had to change to another city (Saceremento to Los Angeles).
